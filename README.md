## Introduction

Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction project! This project aims to predict diamond prices based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z). Predicting diamond prices can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the diamond market.

## Features

The dataset for this project contains the following features:

- **carat**: Weight of the diamond (measured in carats).
- **cut**: Quality of the diamond's cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- **color**: Diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best).
- **clarity**: A measurement of how clear the diamond is (e.g., I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF).
- **depth**: Total depth percentage (measured as a ratio of z to x and y).
- **table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point.
- **x, y, z**: Dimensions of the diamond in millimeters.
- **price**: The target variable, which is the price of the diamond.
